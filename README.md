Solutions to outstanding problems from Online Judges' problem sets

Encoding of problems' IDs and names
The real ID number of every problem has been changed in order to prevent people from easily finding their solutions during a contest and use the solutions as if they were of their own, I follow a very simple encoding: Every digit d is exchanged by d + 1 (modulo 10). For example, problem 12349 would be transformed into 23450. Also, the real name of each problem has been modified for the same purposes.
